# Fountain Code: Efficient Python Implementation of LT Codes

This project is the implementation in Python of the iterative encoding and iterative decoding algorithms of the [LT Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LT_codes),
an error correction code based on the principles of [Fountain Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_code) by Michael Luby.
I have written a whole article on LT Codes and this snippet that you can find here : [franpapers.com](https://franpapers.com/en/algorithmic/2018-introduction-to-fountain-codes-lt-codes-with-python/)

The encoder and decoder are optimized to handle big transfers for files between 1MB to 1GB at high speed.

### Installation

This implementation requires at least python 3.x.
Some packages are not built-in. To install them with `pip` you can do:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

An example describing how to use the implementation is in `lt_codes.py`, and you can use it to encode/decode a file on the fly (creates a file copy):
```
$ python lt_codes.py filename [-h] [-r REDUNDANCY] [--systematic] [--verbose] [--x86]
```

As an example, here is a basic test to ensure the integrity of the final file:
```
$ echo "Hello!" > test.txt
$ python lt_codes.py test.txt --systematic
```
A new file test-copy.txt should be created with the same content.

### Content

* `core.py` contains the Symbol class, constants and functions that are used in both encoding and decoding.
* `distributions.py` contains the two functions that generate degrees based on the ideal soliton and robust soliton distributions
* `encoder.py` contains the encoding algorithm
* `decoder.py` contains the decoding algorithm
* `md5_checker.sh` calls `lt_codes.py` and then compare the integrity of the original file with the newly created file. The integrity check is made with `md5sum`, add the ".exe" if you work on Window. Replace it by `md5 -r` if you work on Mac, or run `brew install md5sha1sum`.

## Benchmarks
The time consumed by the encoding and decoding process is completely related to the size of the file to encode and the wanted redundancy.
I have made some measure on an Intel i5 @ 2.30GHz with a 1.5 redundancy :

Note: `PACKET_SIZE` is set to 65536 for theses tests. Lowering it will result in lower speeds but it might be necessary to send small files in many chunks.
